## What can i do after taking chapter 1?
1. I can make deeplearning network.
2. I can train deeplearning network with data.


## Neural network considers all input layer featurs.
As predicting family size, people consider numbers of bed room and size as variable. But nueral network consider all features like zip code, wealth, nubmer of bed rooms and size. All input layer feature is connected with next layer nodes. 


## Neural network learn pattern by data.
Nerual network doesn't know that family size relies on number of bed rooms and size. But, with many data, neural network can configure patten which map number of bed rooms and size to family size.


## What is supervised learning?
To make neural network that mapping input x into output y.

## What is structed data and unstructed data?
|Feature          |Structed             |Unstructed
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------
|


## What is main reason to take off deeplearning?
1. large amount of data (digitalized)
2. computer calculation power(CPU, GPU)
3. good function like LeRU

Larger model usually show higher performance, need more data. Computaion is more powerful, the cycle is shoten which is consisted of idea -> code -> experiment -> idea ... . Also, some function like ReLU make training speed faster.

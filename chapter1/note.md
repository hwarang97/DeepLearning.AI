## What can i do after taking chapter 1?
1. I can make deeplearning network.
2. I can train deeplearning network with data.


## Neural network considers all input layer featurs.
As predicting family size, people consider numbers of bed room and size as variable. But nueral network consider all features like zip code, wealth, nubmer of bed rooms and size. All input layer feature is connected with next layer nodes. 


## Neural network learn pattern by data.
Nerual network doesn't know that family size relies on number of bed rooms and size. But, with many data, neural network can configure patten which map number of bed rooms and size to family size.
